			<p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. It describes the structure of a web page using elements â€” you can think of it like a foundational skeletal system for a website. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specifies the layout of a web page, including the color, font, font size, spacing, layout, and responsiveness. You can think of it like the skin of a website.</p>

			<p style="color: white;">JavaScript (JS), and extensions of JS such as React and TypeScript, program the functional behavior of web pages. You can think of it like the muscles for a website.JavaScript is a programming language. HTML and CSS are markup languages, so they are technically not programming languages, but they are crucial for the look and feel of a website.This lab will focus on reviewing the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as a little JavaScript. By the end of the lab you will demonstrate these skills by creating a prototype web page of the ucsd.edu homepage. Everyone will create and submit their own page, but you are encouraged to pair up to discuss concepts and methods and learn from each other. Relevant online documentation is linked at the end of each task as a starting point for you to learn the required concepts. You can complete this lab at your own pace; for instance, if you are more experienced with web programming and are familiar with the concepts, feel free to skip or skim over the linked resources if you're able to accomplish each task on your own.</p>

				<div class="box">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>
				<div class="box">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</div>
				<div class="box">"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</div>
